2. List two reasons why representing signed integers using the method of two's complement is superior to representation using the method of one's complement.
*
Simpler Arithmetic Operations:
In two's complement, addition and subtraction of signed integers can be performed using the same circuitry as for unsigned integers. There is no need for a separate subtraction circuit, simplifying the design.
One's complement requires additional logic for end-around carry and handling negative zero, making arithmetic operations more complex.
Single Representation for Zero:
Two's complement eliminates the issue of having two representations for zero (positive zero and negative zero) present in one's complement.
This simplifies comparisons and avoids potential inconsistencies when manipulating zero in mathematical operations.

5. List the categories of processor commands and briefly explain each category.
*
Processor commands can be broadly categorized into three main types:

Arithmetic Commands:
These commands perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Examples include ADD (addition), SUB (subtraction), MUL (multiplication), and DIV (division).
Arithmetic commands manipulate data stored in registers or memory locations.
Control Flow Commands:
These commands control the flow of execution within a program by altering the sequence of instructions.
Examples include JMP (jump), JZ (jump if zero), JNE (jump if not equal), and CALL (call subroutine).
Control flow commands are crucial for implementing loops, conditional statements, and function calls.
Data Transfer Commands:
These commands move data between registers, memory locations, and input/output devices.
Examples include MOV (move), LOAD (load from memory), STORE (store to memory), and IN/OUT (input/output).
Data transfer commands facilitate the movement of data within the processor and between the processor and external devices.
These categories encompass the fundamental types of commands that processors execute to perform a wide range of tasks, from basic arithmetic calculations to managing program flow and handling data transfer operations.

6. What is the purpose of the instruction register, and what is the purpose of the counter register?
*

7. What is software engineering? List the basic phases in software development and briefly explain each of them.
*
Software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. It involves applying engineering principles to software development to ensure the production of high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

The basic phases in software development are typically:

Requirements Analysis:
Identify and document the software requirements, including functional and non-functional aspects.
Involve stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
Design:
Create a detailed blueprint of the software based on the requirements.
Define the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for the system.
Implementation (Coding):
Translate the design into actual code.
Write and test individual components or modules.
Testing:
Verify that the software works as intended and meets the specified requirements.
Identify and fix defects or issues through various testing methods.
Deployment:
Release the software for users or clients.
Install, configure, and ensure the system works in the target environment.
Maintenance:
Address issues discovered after deployment.
Make enhancements or modifications to improve the software over time.
These phases follow a systematic and iterative process, often referred to as the software development life cycle (SDLC), to ensure the successful creation and evolution of software products.

8. Explain BCD system and represent the number 873 in one of the codes of this system.

*
BCD (Binary Coded Decimal):
BCD is a binary representation of decimal values where each decimal digit is encoded using a fixed number of binary bits. In BCD, each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent.

Representation of the Number 873 in BCD:

8 in BCD is 1000
7 in BCD is 0111
3 in BCD is 0011
Combine these BCD representations:
BCD
(
873
)
=
1000
 
0111
 
0011
BCD(873)=100001110011

9. What is a bus, and what is its purpose? Which signals are transmitted through the bus?

*
bus in computing refers to a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between multiple computers. Its purpose is to provide a communication pathway for the exchange of information between different parts of a computer system.

Signals transmitted through the bus include:

Address Bus:
Carries the memory addresses of data being read from or written to. Determines the location in memory or I/O device.
Data Bus:
Transfers actual data between the CPU, memory, and peripherals. It carries the binary information being processed.
Control Bus:
Manages the synchronization and control signals for coordinating activities between different components.
Signals include read and write control, interrupt requests, clock signals, and others.
The bus acts as a communication highway, facilitating the flow of information between the CPU, memory, and other peripheral devices in a computer system. It enables the coordination and synchronization of data transfers, ensuring the proper functioning of the entire system.
