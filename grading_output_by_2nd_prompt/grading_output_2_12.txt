    {
      "answer": "Easier arithmetic operations, and unique representation of zero",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer provides two reasons why two's complement is superior to one's complement, but it lacks clarity and explanation. Real-world examples could be used to illustrate the advantages of two's complement over one's complement."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Because we have to represent analog signal as bits",
      "grade": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer is partially correct but lacks a complete explanation. It could be improved by providing more details about the process of discretization-quantization and its significance in sound representation in a computer."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Ascii is for character representation, every character has its ascii code. 7 (newer 8) bits",
      "grade": 5,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it lacks clarity and detail. Real-world examples could be used to illustrate the significance of ASCII codes in modern computing."

      "answer": "In BCD, every digit from decimal system has its binary representation, 873 would be 1000 0111 0011",
      "grade": 4,
      "explanation": "The answer attempts to explain the BCD system and represent the number 873, but it lacks accuracy and clarity. Real-world examples of BCD representation could help in understanding its significance."

    {
      "answer": "In computer science, a bus is a system of pathways for transferring data between components of a computer system. There are different types of buses, including a data bus, address bus, and control bus.",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a clear understanding of a bus and its purpose. It could be improved by providing real-world examples of bus operations to enhance the explanation."
