    {
      "answer": "Unique representation of zero, simpler operations of addition and subtraction",
      "grade": 7,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the reasons why two's complement is superior to one's complement for representing signed integers. However, it could be improved by providing real-world examples to illustrate the significance of these reasons."
    },
    {
      "answer": "because we need to transform an analog signal to digital",
      "grade": 5,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the purpose of discretization-quantization when representing sound in a computer. However, it lacks clarity and detail in explaining the process. Real-world examples of sound representation could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Representation of characters. 8 bits",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the purpose of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it could be improved by providing more details about the significance of 8 bits and real-world examples of ASCII code usage."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Data commands, control and arithmetic commands",
      "grade": 4,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the categories of processor commands but lacks clarity and detail in explaining each category. Real-world examples of instructions in each category could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Instruction register holds current instruction; counter register holds the next instruction to be executed",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer clearly explains the purpose of the instruction register and the counter register. It could be further improved by providing real-world examples of how these registers are used in processor operations."

    {
      "answer": "1000 0011 0111",
      "grade": 2,
      "explanation": "The answer attempts to represent the number 873 in BCD, but it is incorrect. The explanation lacks clarity and understanding of the BCD system. Real-world examples of BCD representation could help in understanding its significance."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Bus is a communication path, it is for transmitting data, control signals and addresses",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the purpose of a bus and mentions some of the signals transmitted through the bus. However, it could be improved by explaining the specific role of each type of bus and providing real-world examples of bus operations."
