    {
      "answer": "only one way to represent zero and addition has less steps",
      "grade": 4,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly mentions one reason for the superiority of two's complement over one's complement. However, it lacks clarity and explanation of the second reason. Real-world scenarios could be provided to illustrate the superiority of two's complement over one's complement."
    },
    {
      "answer": "because computer use bits to work with so we must translate natural signal to digital",
      "grade": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the reason for discretization-quantization when representing sound in a computer. However, it lacks detail and real-world examples to illustrate the significance of this process in sound representation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "they represent characters. 8 bits",
      "grade": 7,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the purpose of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it could be improved by providing more details about the extended ASCII and its significance in modern computing."
