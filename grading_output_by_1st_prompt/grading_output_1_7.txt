    {
      "answer": "The operation of one machine depends solely on its current state, while the operation of the other depends on both its current state and what is at the input.",
      "grade": 7,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the difference between Moore's and Mealy's machines. However, it lacks clarity and could be improved by providing more details and real-world examples of their applications."
    },
    {
      "answer": "It has a unique representation of zero.",
      "grade": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer only mentions one reason for the superiority of two's complement over one's complement. It lacks clarity and explanation of the second reason. Real-world scenarios could be provided to illustrate the significance of two's complement representation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "This is done to collect data from the real world and translate it into the digital realm.",
      "grade": 5,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the purpose of discretization-quantization when representing sound in a computer. However, it lacks clarity and could be improved by providing more technical details and real-world examples."
    },
    {
      "answer": "ASCII code is used to represent characters in strings. It consists of 8 bits.",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the purpose of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it could be improved by providing more details about the extended ASCII and its significance in modern computing."
    },
    {
      "answer": "1. Data manipulation commands (deal with the transportation of data) 2. Control commands (the brain of everything, determining what needs to be done) 3. Arithmetic-logical commands (used for arithmetic and logical operations on data)",
      "grade": 5,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the categories of processor commands but lacks clarity and detail in explaining each category. Real-world examples of instructions in each category could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Instruction register stores the currently executing command, while the counter register keeps track of which command is next to be executed.",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer clearly explains the purpose of the instruction register and the counter register. It could be further improved by providing real-world examples of how these registers are used in processor operations."
    },
    {
      "answer": "No answer provided",
      "grade": 0,
      "explanation": "No answer provided. The grade is zero."
    },
    {
      "answer": "In the BCD system, each digit in the decimal number is represented using its binary equivalent. Therefore, 873 would be represented as 1000 0011 0111 in BCD.",
      "grade": 2,
      "explanation": "The answer attempts to explain the BCD system and represent the number 873 in BCD, but it is incorrect. The explanation lacks clarity and understanding of the BCD system. Real-world examples of BCD representation could help in understanding its significance."
    },
    {
      "answer": "A bus is a pathway through which all components communicate, either directly or indirectly connected to it. It transmits data, addresses, and control signals.",
      "grade": 7,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the purpose of a bus and mentions some of the signals transmitted through the bus. However, it could be improved by explaining the specific role of each type of bus and providing real-world examples of bus operations."
    },
    {
      "answer": "https://cs.elfak.ni.ac.rs/II_godina/spisak_studenata.html",
      "grade": 10,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly provides the URL address for the given page, including the domain, directory, and page name. It is accurate and complete."
