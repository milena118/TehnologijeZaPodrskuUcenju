    {
      "answer": "The output of Moore's machine depends on the current state and the input, while Mealy's machine depends only on the current state.",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a clear differentiation between Moore's and Mealy's machines. It accurately explains the difference in output dependency. However, it could be improved by providing real-world examples of their applications to enhance understanding."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Easier addition and easier substraction.",
      "grade": 3,
      "explanation": "The answer mentions the ease of addition and subtraction, but it lacks clarity and explanation. It could be improved by providing a more detailed comparison and real-world scenarios to illustrate the superiority of two's complement over one's complement."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Because for the further work we need signal in digital form, not analog.",
      "grade": 5,
      "explanation": "The answer partially explains the purpose of discretization-quantization in representing sound in a computer. It could be improved by elaborating on the need for digital signals and providing real-world examples of sound representation in digital form."
    },
    {
      "answer": "ASCII's purpose is representation of characters in coding, one code has 8 bits.",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the purpose of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it could be improved by providing more details about the extended ASCII and its significance in modern computing."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Data commands, control commands and arithmetic-logical commands.",
      "grade": 4,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of processor commands categories but lacks clarity and detail in explaining each category. Real-world examples of instructions in each category could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Instruction register is for the instruction currently executing, while the counter register is for the memory address of the instruction that is next to be executed.",
      "grade": 9,
      "explanation": "The answer clearly explains the purpose of the instruction register and the counter register. It could be further improved by providing real-world examples of how these registers are used in processor operations."
    },
    {
      "answer": "No answer provided",
      "grade": 0,
      "explanation": "No answer provided. The grade is zero."
    },
    {
      "answer": "BCD stands for Binary Coded Decimal and it is a system where one digit from the decimal system is represented with its binary representation. 873 is 100000110111 in BCD.",
      "grade": 2,
      "explanation": "The answer attempts to explain the BCD system and represent the number 873 in BCD, but it is incorrect. It lacks clarity and understanding of the BCD system. Real-world examples of BCD representation could help in understanding its significance."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Bus is the main communication pathway.",
      "grade": 4,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of a bus but lacks detail and clarity in explaining its purpose and the signals transmitted through it. Real-world examples of bus operations could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "http://cs.elfak.ni.ac.rs/II_godina/spisak_studenta.html",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer provides the URL address for the given page, including the domain, directory, and page name. It is accurate and complete. However, there is a minor typo in the page name ('spisak_studenta' instead of 'spisak_studenata')."
