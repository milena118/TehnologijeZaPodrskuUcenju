    {
      "answer": "Easier arithmetic operations, and unique representation of zero",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly lists two reasons why representing signed integers using two's complement is superior to one's complement. However, it could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation and real-world scenarios of their applications."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Because we have to represent analog signal as bits",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of discretization-quantization in sound representation, but it lacks clarity and detail in explaining the process. Real-world examples of sound representation in a computer could enhance the explanation."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Ascii is for character representation, every character has its ascii code. 7 (newer 8) bits",
      "grade": 6,
      "explanation": "The answer correctly identifies the purpose of ASCII codes and the number of bits used to represent them. However, it could be improved by providing more details about the extended ASCII and its significance in modern computing."

    {
      "answer": "Instruction register is for current command, while counter register is for the next command that is going to be executed",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the purpose of the instruction register and the counter register. However, it could be further improved by providing real-world examples of how these registers are used in processor operations."

    {
      "answer": "In BCD, every digit from decimal system has its binary representation, 873 would be 1000 0111 0011",
      "grade": 2,
      "explanation": "The answer attempts to explain the BCD system and represent the number 873, but it is incorrect. The explanation lacks clarity and understanding of the BCD system. Real-world examples of BCD representation could help in understanding its significance."
    },
    {
      "answer": "In computer science, a bus is a system of pathways for transferring data between components of a computer system. There are different types of buses, including a data bus, address bus, and control bus.",
      "grade": 8,
      "explanation": "The answer provides a basic understanding of the purpose of a bus and mentions some of the signals transmitted through the bus. However, it could be improved by explaining the specific role of each type of bus and providing real-world examples of bus operations."
